# FinalYearProject
Bootstrap learning tutorial website.

#How to use
- Download the complete project and extract into a folder on your PC. 
- Install Visual Studio 2015 (or newer)
- Open BootstrapLearningExperience.sln with Visual Studio. 
- Run the website. 

For convinience the website is running at http://sc12jcce.co.uk. 

The website requires a lot of configuration server side, and would be excessive to detail. The code within these files can be 
viewed by downloading the project, and the live website can be used for an experience of the code in practice.
